This is the second in a series of posts in which I'll review my year in 2015.

Almost every second of my time alive is spent listening to music. Stepping back to view my tastes on a larger scale across my life I have listened to an eclectic and varied mix of music, but each few years is often dominated by one particular sound.

The current wave I'm riding right now is a more electronic/future/soulful vibe being put out by collectives like [Soulection](https://soundcloud.com/soulection) and [Huh, What and Where](https://soundcloud.com/huhwhatandwhere).

2015 has been a fantastic year for this new vibe, ever evolving and refining the raw 2011-12 sound, championed by artists such as [AbJo](https://soundcloud.com/midnightabjo), [Tom Misch](https://soundcloud.com/tommisch), [Sam Gellaitry](https://soundcloud.com/samgellaitry) and [GEOTHEORY](https://soundcloud.com/geotheorymusic).

I have spent some time compiling my personal favourites of the year. Check them out here as a playlist on Soundcloud.
