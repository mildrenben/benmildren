I'll preface this blog post by saying that I (generally) don't have as much time as I'd like to play video games anymore and as such I tend to prefer smaller experiences than lengthier ones. This is not to say that I don't enjoy sinking 100 hours into a game, it just means I have to be selective about the ones I do sink a lot of time into.

As always last year was a fantastic year for games. Lots of great AAA titles as well as some smaller indie gems.

I'll make this as simple as possible and just try to give a quick rundown of each game I've played this year, with scores where possible (Note - this is for games I've played this year, not necessarily games released this year).

## Virtual Reality

Before we really kick this list off I want to spend a moment talking about Virtual Reality. As I'm sure many of you will know, Oculus and HTC will be launching the Rift and Vive this year, respectively. PSVR is also being touted as an end of 2016 release but nothing concrete is set for Sony's headset, so I'll be leaving it out of the conversation.

Having followed Oculus and the development of the Rift over the past 3 years it is pretty wild to think we're within a few months of getting our hands on this revolutionary piece of tech. Strangely I never ended up buying a DK1 or DK2, looking back I'm not sure why I never did but it's quite nice now as getting my CV1 will be a completely new experience. I have actually used the DK2 on 3 separate occasions, each for around 5 minutes and it was mind blowing. I distinctly remember my jaw dropping when trying the Rift for the first time at EGX in London back in 2014. It really cannot be overstated just how cool this thing is.

Eagerly waiting for the preorder page to refresh at the start of January, I was surprised to see the price tag of £529 (plus you need an £800+ PC). That is quite steep, especially after Palmer Luckey alluded to a much lower price, however I won't go off on a tangent about the cost. I hit the preorder button a few hours after the page was up after thinking about it for quite some time. The overall cost of this will be considerable, but honestly quite cheap for such a revolutionary piece of kit. Now I'm kind of glad they went for that price point and have built the best VR headset they can rather than ship a cheaper worse product.

Of course I've also been following the HTC Vive and all other VR headsets. I am no Oculus fanboy, I'll buy what's best. So I'm waiting for the Vive's preorder at the end of this month (February) and will see the price before making a decision.

Back to the actual Rift itself. I've had two experiences in my life that were truly 'WOW! Everyone needs this'. The first was when I tried the Wii in 2006 and the second when I bought the first iPhone in 2007. VR headsets are the next WOW moment for everybody. In 10 years nearly everyone will own one of some description, just like nearly everyone owns a phone like the iPhone ten years on from its release.

To conclude (because otherwise this is going to get long), I have never been more excited for something as I am for my Rift (or Vive) to arrive. I absolutely cannot wait. And you're all invited for a demo!

## Super Smash Bros for Wii U and 3DS

**Time played: 250+ hours**

Released at the end of 2014 the new Smash Bros game took my life by storm. After purchasing a copy for both my 3DS and my Wii U (and subsequently hunting down a gamecube controller adapter) I couldn't stop myself playing in the first few months. I even put 11 hours into the 3DS demo!

Every day during the evening my brother and I would play for 1-2 hours, every single night without fail. Granted, this isn't the beloved Melee, but it's fantastic in it's own right. It's supposed to appeal to a wider audience than it's competitive sibling Melee. There aren't the exploits/tech skill that exist in Melee like wavedashing and L-cancelling, but new tech is being discovered all the time and I'm sure soon Smash 4 will have some sweet tech skill of it's own.

The best way to describe Smash 4 is: I do not watch it over Melee, but I play it over Melee. Melee is faster and more exciting as a spectator sport, but the accessibility of Smash 4 is undeniable which makes it perfect for players without the time to invest in learning Melee. For me, it's just as much fun when you're playing too.

The online play is just awesome (with a LAN adapter) hosting up to 4 players and a For Glory mode for the more hardcore players.

The addition of Amiibos is a ton of fun too, kind of like having your own Pokemon that you train up and teach moves.

Along with a wide and diverse roster of interesting characters, 8 player smash, Gamecube controller support, a ton of different modes and campaign, fantastic affordable DLC and that classic Smash gameplay I know I'll be playing this one for a long long time.

## Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons

**Time played: 3 hours [Completed]**

Picked this up during a sale after seeing rave reviews about it on Reddit. Beautiful art style and an interesting concept (you control two people) made Brothers a great game. The puzzle elements were somewhat lackluster but that doesn't stop Brothers being a worthy way to spend 3 hours of your time. Unfortunately, I felt it wasn't as good as a lot of people on Reddit made it out to be.

## Don't Starve

**Time played: 90 minutes**

This one just didn't click with me. I couldn't get into it at all. I can't even tell you why, it just didn't really do anything for me. Permadeath is generally something I dislike so there is that. I didn't played it long enough to get past the early game, so I'm sure the mid game and end game were a lot more interesting but I didn't want to commit the time as it didn't grab me by the balls at the start.

## F.E.A.R 3

**Time played: 8 hours [Completed]**

Ahhh I love me a FEAR game. They're never ground braking, game of the year or even innovative in any fashion but they do offer a decent atmosphere and solid gunplay. If you're interested in playing a game that walks a well trodden FPS path with some scares thrown in then you'll do well with FEAR 3.

## Rocket League

**Time played: 65 hours**

Rocket League though. A breath of fresh air in this era of gaming, Rocket League is a true innovator combining RC cars with football. It's addictively fun and you'll keep wanting to play game after game. Rocket League is one of those rare games that caters to hardcore and casual alike, with a low skill floor and very high skill ceiling with lots of depth all round.

When I first jumped on starting a game with friends and we would laugh so much and missing the ball, and hitting the ball felt like such a monumental accomplishment! Now we're hitting wild aerials and all sorts of things we would've never dreamed of a few months back and we're still having a blast. It's what games are ultimately for, having a truck load of fun.

A true masterpiece.

## Prison Architect

**Time played: 90 minutes**

I am not equipped to review this game in any worthwhile form, I need to play it way more. It seems like the type of game I'll love (Theme Hospital is my jam) but I simply haven't had the time to play it. Maybe this year.

## SteamWorld Dig

**Time played: 4 hours [Completed]**

What a wonderful little game this one turned out to be. Games like SteamWorld Dig are the reason I go through smaller indie titles, I loved it! You start off as a Robot with only the most basic equipment and have to dig down and find materials for upgrades as well as complete objectives to advance the story and move on to new areas. I think the reason I liked it so much was the upgrades to my tools and weapons. When a game does progression well it's very noticeable and SteamWorld Dig was brilliant at progression. One of those games where you're sad when it ends!

## Angvik

**Time played: 30 mins**

A weird kind of rogue like game where you try and get as far as possible. Angvik has a small amount of random elements to it to mix up each attempt, but I never really found it very enjoyable. Not for me.

## Serious Sam 3: BFE

**Time played: 14 hours [Completed]**

Serious Sam 3 was only in my Steam library because it came with a bundle at some point, I never intended to play it. When deciding what game to play next one day, I asked my girlfriend to pick one from my library and this was it. I was close to asking her to choose again but am glad I didn't.

Anyone that knows my gaming preferences knows that I adore Doom and it's frantic pace and constant action. I wasn't expecting SS3 to be a modern reincarnation of such a game (I went into it not really checking to even see what the game was about). It really is just mindless shooting things for the sake of shooting things, but by god if it isn't satisfying and challenging! SS3 really managed to capture the essence of Doom (without the atmosphere) better than I've seen any other game do. Solid game, really enjoyed it.

## The Binding of Isaac

**Time played: 7 hours**

I've had Isaac in my library for quite some time and just a few months got round to actually playing it. Time goes fast on Isaac, it's super easy to spend a couple hours on it. It's testament to how good the game is that I actually spent 7 hours with it, as it's not really my type of game. The permadeath is both frustrating and what kept luring me back to it, always wanting to get further and further. Fun items, great humour and addictive combat make it an interesting play for people that don't even like roguelikes.

## Teslagrad

**Time played: 5 hours [Completed]**

What a gorgeous and quirky little game Teslagrad turned out to be! The old school Disney hand drawn Disney feel enticed me to buy it and it did not disappoint. A super enjoyable puzzle platformer based on the phsyics of magnetism. Well worth a play for anyone who enjoys puzzle platformers.

It's one of those games where you really should check out a trailer for it, it's such a beautiful world they created and the magnetism mechanics felt perfect. Progression was also top notch, always acquiring new interesting items just when the old ones were getting a little stale.

**Score: 7.5/10**

## Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery

**Time played: 90 minutes**

Superbrothers looked so promising when checking out the trailers, but it was such a let down in reality. The pixel art is breathtaking, however that's all I can really say for the game. Felt like a mobile game rather than a fully fledged title (probably because it is also available on mobiles).

## Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon

**Time played: 9 hours [Completed]**

The second installment in the Luigi's Mansion series was gripping from start to end. Unfortunately I cannot draw comparisons to the Gamecube version as I never got around to playing that, although after playing Dark Moon I will likely pick it up.

It has that whimsical charm that Nintendo nails time and time again. Playful animations, fantastic core gameplay and great level design make Dark Moon a must play for any 3DS owner. Sucking up those ghosts never gets old!

## Hurtworld

**Time played: 36 hours**

Me and my buddies had been debating whether to try out one of the popular survival games like Rust or DayZ. Just as we were deciding Hurtworld was released and we all agreed that it looked fantastic.

The graphics are similar in style to Team Fortress 2 making it very easy on the eyes and playable on modest computer builds (as well as some awesome optimisation). The gameplay is pretty hardcore survival with hunger and temperature gauges knocking on your door frequently letting you know you'll die if you stay out in the sun any longer. The gameplay was super fun and we had a blast making enemies, killing animals and crafting new items.

As the game is in Alpha, there are a number of issues like a lack of end game content. The thing that drove us away in the end was the server wipes. Roughly every month or so the servers get wiped (depending on the admins), and with that wipe your entire months work has been undone. I completely understand why servers are being wiped and it's to be expected with the game being in Alpha, but it's starts to get annoying, so we ended up stopping playing.

Overall it was brilliant in the time we had with it and we will definitely be returning to it in a few months time to see what updates have been made to the game. Highly recommended for survival lovers.

## Halo 5: Guardians

**Time played: 90 hours [Completed]**

The Xbox One in my living room was only ever purchased to play Halo and Gears of War. The system doesn't have many good exclusives besides the aforementioned duo, so I was hoping Gears of War Ultimate Edition and Halo 5 were going to be fantastic.

Halo 5: Guardians lived up to my expectations, for a short while. I remember the days of Halo 3 when it became a staple part of my gaming for the next few years and I really wanted to be playing Halo 5 years past release. Halo 5 has already kind of dropped off of my radar just 3 months on from launch. I think one of the main reasons is lack of content. It obviously had to hit deadlines and was released in an unfinished state, omitting Halo classics like Forge mode, Big Team Battles, social playlists and custom game options. Where is the doubles game mode? Where is the CTF only game mode (or even Team Objective)? Some of the decisions are baffling.

On a better note, the core gameplay and campaign are excellent. I persevered through the campaign on Legendary solo and it was absolutely amazing. Loved every minute of it. The graphics are great, the weapons feel solid, the worlds I was dropped in to were gorgeous and the soundtrack was breathtaking. Seriously, the score for this game is one of the best I've ever heard. The story is a little strange but it didn't stop me from really enjoying the campaign.

The online was also great for the time that I played it. Gone are the crappy loadouts from Halo 4 and all the abilities introduced in Reach. Now everyone is equipped with sprint and thruster, which actually improve the gameplay rather than detract like the abilities before it. Coupled with the new clamber feature, mobility in Halo 5 is drastically quicker, bringing it more in line with modern FPS's but still maintaining that distinctive Halo feel. It's different, it's not Halo 3 anymore, but it feels good, a step in the right direction, an evolution of the series.

My favourite addition to Halo 5 is the is the Warzone multiplayer game modes. They're an absolute blast with some friends and downright addictive when trying to get more REQ points to unlock packs of gear to use in your next fight. Again, lack of maps made the mode a little stale after a while, I mean 3 maps is just not enough. They have since added another map through free DLC, but player retention will always be low if there isn't enough at the start.

Overall it still feels like a worthy Halo title and I will likely go back to it at some point.

## Gears of War: Ultimate Edition

**Time played: 39 hours**

As mentioned above, I bought my Xbox One purely for Gears and Halo. Gears of War 1 and Halo 3 were my most played games back in the day and I wanted to relive those moments again on Xbox One. Sure Gears UE is just Gears 1 with a reskin and couple of fixes here and there but I was still super hyped. Me and my buddies were ready to have Gears and Halo back in our lives and re-live the golden days.

Gears UE follows a similar story to Halo 5 - I loved it and played it to death in it's first few weeks of release, but then it kind of fell by the wayside. Suffering almost the exact same fate of Halo 5, Gears UE had some very questionable and poor decisions regarding game modes. Warzone and Execution were only 4 rounds to win, like wtf Epic? I have no idea why they did this, it makes zero sense. They have recently changed it to first to 5 on Execution but as I mentioned in the Halo 5 it's too little too late. Most of the original userbase will have left by now. They also removed Warzone all together, why?! They seem to think that Team Deathmatch is a more worthy game mode than Warzone, as Team Deathmatch remains, which is just not the Gears 1 I remember and love.

Outside of gamemodes they have fixed a few bugs and removed the notoriously horrible one shot down sniper which is a great addition. The game also looks gorgeous with it's new and improved textures and lighting.

Although I haven't touched the campaign, I've been told it's plagued by awful framerates which is a shame. Again like Halo 5, this game feels rushed for release before the holidays. Microsoft obviously realised that the Xbox One was being beat out by the PS4 and wanted to get their two flag ship titles out before the holidays, to the detriment of the quality of the games.

Despite this critical analysis, I've played it quite a lot and enjoyed it a lot. I'm never going to be 15 again playing Gears 1 for the first time, but this doesn't feel too far off of it. I will be coming back to Gears for quite a while I feel.

## Super Mario Maker

**Time played: 11 hours**

My girlfriend bought me this as a Christmas gift, so my time with it in 2015 was limited. From my short time with the game it's pretty easy to tell just how good it is. It oozes quality in every department.

In typical Nintendo fashion it falls slightly short in the social/online aspect, although this is be Nintendo's best effort in the online space so far and the issues I have with it are pretty tough to fix. It's not Nintendo's usual online failures either. You can follow people to get their latest maps, you can star levels, there's a plethora of ways to find maps, Nintendo runs a brilliant 'event mode' where they put out their own maps, and you can see some cool stats on each map like completion percentage and world record time. Where the online falls short is actually something that is very hard to get right and isn't just something Nintendo would struggle with. I'm referring to the finding and displaying of high quality level.s

Other than the (small) shortcomings in the online aspect, I cannot find a single fault. This game is absolutely outstanding in every respect. Building levels using the touch screen is perfect. The UI is just drop dead gorgeous. The amount of items, level backgrounds and game styles is more than enough. All the different modes are fantastic. And, of course, the platforming is as good as it's ever been.

Using sites like Reddit to find and follow the best makers out there makes the whole thing flawless. The ingenuity of some of these levels is out of this world. Some go beyond the quality of Nintendo's own levels. Puzzles, platforming, aesthetics, it's all here and then some.

If you own a Wii U, just go buy it.

## Antichamber

**Time played: 7 hours**

I'll kick this one off by saying that it's not for everyone. The closest game you can compare it to is Portal, but even then Antichamber is uniquely different. It is absolutely innovative in such a beautiful way.

I picked Antichamber up on the cheap during a Steam sale towards the end of the year. I did not expect such a masterpiece. There is almost nothing negative to say about it. The only criticism I can muster is it's confusing when you first jump on it. For the first 30-60 minutes you will be a little disorientated, which could easily put people off, but anyone that makes it past this will be in for a brilliant game.

Antichamber employs a non-euclidean map, which is half the reason it's confusing at first. The non-euclidean nature of the game adds to many of the puzzles and brings the whole world together in spectacular fashion.

The art style, the clinical minimal world, the 'weapon' that you use to move blocks; everything is unique in Antichamber, everything is different.

I would call it an exploration game just as much of a puzzler. Or at least that exploring the world and piecing it together is the biggest puzzle in the game. There are so many 'aha!' moments when you figure out that this room connects to that room. 'Oh yeah, I've been here before' was thought many times.

The progression of the 'guns' was very well paced too. The puzzles were kind of colour coded to show which gun you would need for that section, which aided in understanding which direction to pursue. In that sense I guess it's kind of open world, it's certainly not linear. I say kind of open world because it's not really. The world isn't enormous like some vast spanning Witcher 3 type world, and you can't always go to certain areas before others.

It's really hard to encapsulate Antichamber in words. I would just run out of superlatives if I did anyway. The most fitting word, which I've used a lot already, is unique. You truly have to play it to really get a feel for what this game is. The puzzles are perfectly progressive, always offering a good challenge and a very satisfying success.

I just cannot overstate how brilliant this game really is. I was so sad when it came to an end but also felt a great sense of accomplishment. It's like some weird mix of trippy drug induced experience and game. It really stayed with me after completion. Loved every minute of it. Perfect.

## Pokemon Omega Ruby

**Time played: 48 hours**

I'll keep this one short because everyone knows Pokemon. I'm a huge fan of the series, played every main entry and love them all. Omega Ruby is a remake of Ruby for the 3DS, using the same engine X and Y use. So we now have all the bells and whistles from X and Y in Ruby like the 3D battles and 3D overworld. I say 3D, meaning 3D like Super Mario 64 stepped into the third dimension. Only the battles are in 3DS 3D, actually sending two different images to your eyes.

There's not a lot to say here. We all know how Pokemon works, plus it's a remake. A lot of people who are avid fans of a series want a series to move forward and evolve with each iteration but I just want Pokemon to stay exactly the same. I love the core formula so much I don't want anything else. Maybe I'll be proved wrong and they'll add some features or change some things up and I'll love it even more but I can't see it (although it would be amazing). For me I want handheld Pokemon games to be the same forever just with new Pokemon, and try cool new ideas out on the home console. More Colosseum, Snap and Stadium type games on home consoles would be awesome. Pokemon MMORPG on home console would be the best thing to happen ever.
