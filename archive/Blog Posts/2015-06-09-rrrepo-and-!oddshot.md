# rrrepo and oddshot

These last few weeks have been incredibly hectic and busy, but most importantly exciting!

I've launched my personal project I've been working on for the past 6 months. And I have another product launch in less than a weeks time (13th June, 2015).

## rrrepo

We have liftoff! [Check us out!](http://rrrepo.co)

The rundown of what rrrepo does:

The idea for rrrepo was sparked by the interest in [webdesignrepo](http://www.webdesignrepo.com), which I've ran for the past 2 years. After being approached numerous times about setting up repos for other people about other topics, I decided that this needed to be a thing: A place for people to neatly organise the best links on a given subject, and also allow for the community to upvote, comment and submit to that list.

The days of Github lists are over.

The days of entire websites dedicated to a list are over. I'm looking at you [chats.directory](http://chats.directory) - instead you can check out the [slackChats repo](https://rrrepo.co/repo/slackChats).

Please do take a look at [rrrepo](http://rrrepo.co), and sign up for a chance to discover new resources on all of your favourite topics.

During Alpha, we are limiting who can make repos, so if you would like to become a moderator of a repo during the current Alpha phase, please contact us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rrrepo_).

## Oddshot

The fun doesn't stop there.

I'm part of a team that'll be launching a product called Oddshot on the 13th June.

The rundown of what Oddshot does:

Ever been watching a Twitch stream and wanted an instant replay? Well now you can. Oddshot is a browser plugin that allows users to simply type !shot into Twitch chat and you'll be given the last 30 seconds of the stream as a video.

eSports instant replays by the fans, for the fans. This is such a needed step forward in the streaming world that I couldn't be more certain of its success.

We're going to launch !oddshot in style by having the team fly out to Dreamhack in Sweden, one of Europes biggest eSports events.

So these are the 2 products I've been working on for the past 8 weeks solid (and hopefully the next 1 - 3 years), please do check them out :)
