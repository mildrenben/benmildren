Over the past week or so I've been finishing off and polishing a new plugin that I have released.

The plugin is called Betterforms and it provides a whole host of awesome tools for making forms suck less.

Form abandonment rates are insanely high (with Formisimo putting the number as high as 73%), and it's no wander considering how bad forms generally are.

Betterforms aims to bring down that figure down by reducing form abandonment rates and making the user experience and user interface flow a lot of smoother.

Ultimately, Betterforms should increase revenues, sales, signups and any other kind of form you have by making the experience as painless as possible.

## Details

Betterforms is a pure vanilla JS (JavaScript) and CSS plugin, with no dependencies like jQuery. It is lightweight, open-source and can easily integrate into big frameworks or CMS like a Wordpress plugin can.

It is free to use on any non-commercial project, but requires a license for use on commercial projects.

[You can find the licensing details here](http://betterforms.co/license.html)
