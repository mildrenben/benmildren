    <h2>Australian Open Roundup</h2>
    <h5>February 4th, 2015</h5>
  </header>
  <p>It was an intriguing final in Melbourne, as World No. 1 took on long time rival Andy Murray in what was a clash of easily the two best players at the tournament this year. Going in to the match, many fancied the much improved Scot to finally end his Australian hoodoo after displaying an aggressive but controlled game throughout the fortnight. Djokovic, whilst very solid, looked somewhat shaky and belated after a less than high quality encounter with Stanislas Wawrinka in the semis. Their match was nowhere near the quality of recent clashes, namely the semi-final here last year or the US Open match in 2013. Murray on the other hand looked devistating in dismantling the on form Tomas Berdych, who took out Rafael Nadal in straight sets the round before.
  </p>
  <p>
It was clear from the opening that this would be a tight start, with the Serb saving 3 break points early on, before breaking Murray to lead 3-1 and consolidating the break. Murray however hit straight back, eventually forcing a tie break. You got the feeling that the first set was far more important to the Olypmic Gold medalist than Djokovic, and after going up a mini break, Murray dumbfoundedly played a series of nervous shots to hand the initiative to the Serbian tank. Murray was arguably the better player in the opener and started to find his rythmn as the set went on; this continued in to set 2, leading a break at 2-0 up.

  <p>
Djokovic is the world's best player for a reason however and fought straight back to level the scores and take a surprise 4-2 lead. This was quickly becoming an epic, with both players displaying the physical prowess that so typifies their games and ensuring that this was to be a brutal encounter for both. Murrway was begining to crack his opponent, playing some impressive aggressive tennis and forcing the Serb to concentrate hard on holding serve. The second set inevitably went to another tie break where Murray played a great passage, evening up the scores one a piece. Djokovic was looking flustered, tired and displaying a defeated demeanour, often acting as though injured between points. 
 </p>
  <p>
Murray on the other hand was begining to look in his element. The match looked like a case - as so often with these two - of who will tire first and all bets at this point were with Murray running away. After the Scot broke to go 2-0 up in the third, it looked like he would take a comfortable lead in sets and be in with his best chance to finally win a final here. What happened next however is something the former two-time slam winner will want to forget in a hurry. 
 </p>
  <p>
From seemingly nowhere, the usually durable Murray collapsed. Djokovic was able to raise his game to its normal level whilst his counterpart combusted in to obscurity. Murray began making error after error and his second serve resorted back to pre-2012 level, meaning that despite having the break in the third set, he lost it 6-3 and mentally, looked defeated. In the fourth set, some were perhaps expecting a fight back from Murray, the kind which saw him land a US Open, Wimbledon and Olympic Gold medal within the space of 18 months.

  <p>
The fight however was gone and he limped over the finish line, Djokovic finishing the final in devistating fashion by subjecting Murray to a bagel set of 6-0. What is most disappointing about this was the way in which Murray capitulated; what started as a classic final ended up a one sided barrage. Djokovic did what he had to do to win, but didn't have to play outstanding tennis to do so. Had Djokovic played like this at Wimledon last year, Federer would have 18 grand-slam titles. Had Djokovic played like this at the O2, he might not have made the final - this is what will frustrate Murray so much. 
 </p>
  <p>
The Serb undoubtedly deserves his victory and eighth grand-slam and a lot of his tennis was at his usual level. Perhaps his game would have risen to the challenge had Murray continued the way he started and he still would have the win, as so often happens with Novak. But the point is, he didn't have to and that will upset Murray more than losing. However, the Scot can still look back on a successful tournament where he gave himself another chance at landing a third slam. Where Murray goes from here will be telling as he showed that he is back and ready to contest the major titles, but can he defeat arch-rival Djokovic in a final once again? 
 </p>
  <p>
For Djokovic, the sky is the limit from here. The great Serb now has 8 major titles and is the favourite to win them all this year. With Rafael Nadal uncertain in terms of form and fitness, the World No. 1 can certainly set his sights on the elusive French Open in a few months time. A ninth grand-slam would put him in distant sight of catching Nadal's own haul and perhaps even the great Roger Federer's record.
