Hello to everyone reading this post!

This is just a quick update to tell you guys what to expect from this blog going forward.

I solemnly swear to:

* Write awesome posts about HTML and CSS

* Keep you updated regarding my Javascript learning, which needs to be improved

* Post about design as a whole, including UX, UI, graphics and webdesign

* Avoid click-bait post titles

* Occasionally post pictures I've been on and give tips for those using Adobe Lightroom

Hopefully, you'll enjoy reading this blog and learn lots of cool new things.

**2015 is our year!**
