_This post will assume that you have zero experience in coding. I will not really be teaching HTML and CSS, but showing you the best places to learn for free._

So you've decided that you want to learn how to design and develop websites?&nbsp;

Firstly, I don't want to scare anybody off, but I will say that it'll probably be at least a year before you're fully competent in building websites. You need to be committed, enthusiastic, motivated and most importantly disciplined. Motivation is fleeting, discipline is your real friend, nail that down and you'll be half way there.

On the plus side, you will be making things within the first month or so, which is super rewarding and fun.

##HTML and CSS

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML for short) is the standard language that websites are written in.&nbsp;

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS for short) is the standard language for styling HTML.

The best piece of advice I can give is: **practice HTML and CSS everyday if you can!**

Also, keep checking [webdesignrepo](http://www.webdesignrepo.com/) for new learning resources and other design and development related links.

Go through the following resources in order:

* [Don't Fear the Internet](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/the-basics/not-tubes)&nbsp;- A short video series that is a nice, low level introduction into the world of browsers and HTML.

* [Codecademy's HTML and CSS Course](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)&nbsp;- I cannot recommend Codecademy enough, it's been fantastic for my own development and has a whole host of things to learn.

* [Learn to Code HTML and CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)&nbsp;- An excellent walkthrough for learning the fundamentals. The first lesson is great and will have you build your first web page.

* [Dive Into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.info/index.html)&nbsp;- An introduction to HTML5 tags and elements.

* [Learn CSS Layout](http://learnlayout.com/) - Get your site to look how you'd like can be tricky, due to all the nuances with CSS, this site helps to understand it all better.&nbsp;

Although you may feel like you're going over the same things you've already learnt after the Codecademy course, but I urge you to just persevere and work through all the resources above in order. Revisiting certain things will reinforce them.

##Build Something

Once you've completed all the tasks in the above section, I strongly advise you to think of a very simple website and just go for it. The best way to get better with HTML and CSS is to just keep using them and keep building websites.

If you can't think of anything or run out of ideas, ask family members, friends and colleagues what websites would help them or make their lives easier.

If you really want to get something actually on the web, you could buy some cheap web hosting and do it! For web hosting, I'd recommend getting shared hosting and your domain from someone like [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) account and host things there. It's not ideal but it's better than nothing.

##Practice

I pointed it out in the previous section, but it's of the utmost importance that you practice, practice, practice. Even if it's just for 15 minutes, try and use HTML and CSS everyday (I know that's sometimes not practical, but whenever possible).&nbsp;


Make a [Codepen](http://codepen.io/) account and experiment with styles, tags and other little fancies.
