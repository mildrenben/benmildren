I'll get straight to the point: My passwords sucked. Really bad.

They were all pretty much variations of the same password&ndash;and I used it on everything, which is awful practice.

#[LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) to the rescue!

[LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) isn't the only password manager that's held in high regard; there are a bunch of reputable managers out there, you just have to find the one that fits you the best.

Take a look through these discussions on Reddit ([Thread 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/22wzbi/in_wake_of_the_heartbleed_bug_whats_the_best/), [Thread 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/27sff7/best_password_manager/)) about different password managers&ndash;they should be able to direct you to a suitable manager.

I ended up going with LastPass purely because it was the most recommended one, but [Keepass](http://keepass.info/), [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) and [Password Safe](https://www.schneier.com/passsafe.html) all seem like decent options too.

#Just do it

I've been stumbling around the internet for the past 12 months knowing full well that I should be using a more secure method for my passwords, but it was just one of those things I never got around to doing. Just do it! 

After making the plunge, you realise that it takes only 5 minutes to get setup.

Over 1000 login credentials were found by Lastpass on my machine, but it is a hassle to go through and change all of them&ndash;even though there is a handy 1 click password change button for each login. So I went through my top 10-20 most visited and most needing of security login credentials. Obviously, things like my server login and my bank were at the top of the list, but I also changed Facebook and Twitter too.

Hopefully this post will inspire you to make the change too. It takes 5 minutes and makes all your accounts more secure, just do it!
