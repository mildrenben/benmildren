[Twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv) is an absolute phenomonon. It has carved a niche that nobody thought was really needed or necessary. It is simply a website where you can stream yourself playing videogames and watch others doing the same. If you tell someone who hasn't heard of Twitch before about it they'll be like, 'You watch people play games? Why don't you just play them yourself? It's a dumb idea'. I've heard that response a few times.

The thing is is that I totally understand the thought process and would probably say something similar if I'd just heard of Twitch. In paractice though, it's an absolutely amazing product with an even better community that has flourished since it's launch. They sold a few months back to Amazon for $1 billion. That's right, billion.

I watch Twitch for tips, for entertainment and for background noise.

##Introducing Livecoding.tv

[Livecoding.tv](http://www.livecoding.tv) is a new platform for streaming yourself code and watching others code. Currently in private beta, it's a small community of coders.

I truly beleive it has the potential to be huge. I wouldn't say it could reach the lofty heights of Twitch, only because there are more people who play videogames than there will ever be people who code. But that's not to say that it won't see exponential growth in the coming years.

Fortunately, I received an invite to Livecoding a couple of days ago and I've been on the website a hell of a lot since. It's just fantastic!

To me it will serve more purposes than Twitch does. Whilst it will be able to do all the things Twitch does for gamers, it will also be an excellent portal as a learning resource and as a place to see if a new framework/language/whatever is going to suit you and be worth your time.

Since being invited to Livecoding I have streamed 3 times and am aiming to stream for at least an hour a day, everyday.

I cannot overstate my beleif and passion for this new platform and urge everybody to apply for an invite and get involved in the community. As coders and designers, we have a chance to build something great here, together.

Please join me on my stream everyday at [Livecoding.tv/donmildreone](https://www.livecoding.tv/donmildreone/).
