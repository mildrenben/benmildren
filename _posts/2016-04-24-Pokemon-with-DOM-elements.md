Having always been a big Pokemon fan, I figured I'd try something out to try and test some of my JavaScript knowledge.

I set out to make a short proof of concept for a Pokemon style game using HTML, CSS and JS. It's nothing too crazy and it's most certainly not the optimal way to build this but it works surprisingly well.

If you were really serious about making a game in JS, you would probably use JS canvas. I went with using DOM elements and moving the screen and character model around using super simple things like margins at the CSS level.

The battle system isn't perfect, but the while thing actually works which is pretty damn cool.
