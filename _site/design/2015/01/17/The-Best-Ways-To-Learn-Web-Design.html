  <article class="post-content">
    <p><em>If you want to learn how to code HTML and CSS, <a href="http://benmildren.com/coding/2015/01/13/Learning-HTML-and-CSS-Where-to-start.html">see my previous blog post.</a></em></p>

<p>I’ll preface this blog post by saying that Design is not something that can be learnt like one can learn code. It takes a lot of time and experience.</p>

<p>Design is also very subjective. For instance, I love a minimal and simple feel with lots of whitespace; others may prefer a maximalist style with busy patterns and lots of elements on screen. But good design can be found in all shapes and styles, and how the user experiences a website is what is most important.</p>

<p>A large misconception is that web design is purely about the aesthetics. Whilst the visuals are an crucial part, web design is also about how the user interacts with a website.</p>

<p>Think of each website you build like a realy life physical product. When designing for physical products, you would probably think about the functions of the product and making it easy for the user to access each function as easily as possible. This rings true for web design too and should not be understated.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="aesthetic">Aesthetic</h2>

<p>The best thing to do whilst trying to learn great looking websites is look around and attempt to emulate other visually attractive websites.</p>

<p>The following websites can really help learning how to design a websites look and feel:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://dribbble.com/">Dribbble</a> - A fantastic place for viewing what other designers are up to. It’s kind of like a Facebook for designers, a show and tell kind of website. It employs an invite-only system that keeps the work shown there fresh and good quality. You’ll see lots of beautiful designs there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.behance.net/">Behance</a> - Similar to Dribbble, Behance is more like an online portfolio for designers. You’re more likely to see full projects as opposed to Dribbble’s snapshot style pictures, along with explanations on the decisions the designer has made.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/palettes">COLOURlovers</a> - A website to browse beautiful colour schemes. A great place for inspiration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://htmlinspiration.com/">html inspiration</a> - A showcase of brilliantly designed websites for you to peruse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards</a> - Very much like html inspiration, Awwwards tracks beautiful websites and 
gives ratings on each element of the design. Although some of the websites can be a little ‘too flashy’ it still provides a good showcase of websites.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.cssdsgn.com/">CSSDSGN</a> - Again, a showcase of very good looking websites which lean towards the minimal side of the visual spectrum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.typewolf.com/">Typewolf</a> - Typewolf displays the best of typography that can be found online. I really recommend visiting this site regularly, it’s excellent for seeing beautiful typefaces, spacing and poise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://practicaltypography.com/">Butterick’s Practical Guide to Typography</a> - A fantastic guide on typography and how to best show text on your website.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.typogui.de/">Typeguide</a> - Another decent overview of typography.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/28/color-theory-for-designers-part-1-the-meaning-of-color/#top">Color Theory</a> - Color theory is a science in itself. Studying how colors affect different people, either individually or as a group, is something some people build their careers on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm">Compose to a Vertical Rhythm</a> - Despite being from 2006, this article still holds up today. It excellently explains how to space and arrange text on a website.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above websites will help, but I recommend visitng each of them regularly and surrounding yourself by good design everyday. This is how you learn what looks good and what looks bad. It cannot be learned overnight, it is something you’ll always be learning.</p>

<p>Also, if you think you have ‘good taste’ or a ‘decent eye for design’ but still find yourself producing substandard websites, do not worry. Just keep going, you’ll get there with enough experience. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbC4gqZGPSY">This video is great from an industry expert.</a></p>

<h2 id="user-experience">User Experience</h2>

<p>Just like the visual side of things, the actual design of websites will take a long time to learn.</p>

<p>When you’re on a website that feels good to you, you need to be asking yourself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Why does it feel good?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it the spacing I like?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is how easily I can see the information I want?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is how simple it is to navigate?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These are the things you should be thinking and also trying to answer when you’re designing your own websites. Getting the user to their destination is a small amount of time is crucial.</p>

<p>Some great resources on user experience, user interface and design in general are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://goodui.org/">GoodUI</a> - A set of suggestions on things you could try to make your user interace better.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://howtonotsuckonline.com/">How to Not Suck Online</a> - Exactly what it says on the tin really. A bunch of smaller tips on how best to approach web design.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Geting Real</a> - A brilliant ebook on design in general.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-Real-World-Ecology-Social/dp/0500273588">Design for the Real World</a> - Although this book isn’t specifically about designing for the web, it is an outstanding insight into how you should be thinking when designing anything.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://hackdesign.org/lessons">Hack Design</a> - The user experience section is invaluable in teaching yourself to design good websites.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>The best piece of advice I can give for those wanting to learn web design, or improve their current design skills, is exactly the same advice I gave in my previous blog post about coding. You have to try and do it everyday. Only by surrounding yourself with brilliant and beautiful design will some of it start to sink in.</p>
