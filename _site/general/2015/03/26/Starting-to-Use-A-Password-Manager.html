    <p>I’ll get straight to the point: My passwords sucked. Really bad.</p>

<p>They were all pretty much variations of the same password–and I used it on everything, which is awful practice.</p>

<p>#<a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> to the rescue!</p>

<p><a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> isn’t the only password manager that’s held in high regard; there are a bunch of reputable managers out there, you just have to find the one that fits you the best.</p>

<p>Take a look through these discussions on Reddit (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/22wzbi/in_wake_of_the_heartbleed_bug_whats_the_best/">Thread 1</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/27sff7/best_password_manager/">Thread 2</a>) about different password managers–they should be able to direct you to a suitable manager.</p>

<p>I ended up going with LastPass purely because it was the most recommended one, but <a href="http://keepass.info/">Keepass</a>, <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/passsafe.html">Password Safe</a> all seem like decent options too.</p>

<hr />

<p>#Just do it</p>

<p>I’ve been stumbling around the internet for the past 12 months knowing full well that I should be using a more secure method for my passwords, but it was just one of those things I never got around to doing. Just do it!</p>

<p>After making the plunge, you realise that it takes only 5 minutes to get setup.</p>

<p>Over 1000 login credentials were found by Lastpass on my machine, but it is a hassle to go through and change all of them–even though there is a handy 1 click password change button for each login. So I went through my top 10-20 most visited and most needing of security login credentials. Obviously, things like my server login and my bank were at the top of the list, but I also changed Facebook and Twitter too.</p>

<p>Hopefully this post will inspire you to make the change too. It takes 5 minutes and makes all your accounts more secure, just do it!</p>
