    <p>Following my post on <a href="http://benmildren.com/coding/2015/05/02/The-Making-Of-Surface.html">the making of my framework</a>, it has now launched.</p>

<p>##Surface has lifted off!</p>

<p>First and foremost, check it out here at <a href="http://iamsurface.com/">iamsurface.com</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s review what went well, what went wrong and what the future will hold.</p>

<hr />

<p>###What went right?</p>

<p>####CSS only
The biggest limitation I placed upon myself was the CSS only rule. I figured it might be impossible to achieve all the features that I felt were necessary for a framework using only CSS, or SCSS to be more specific. But I was pleasantly surprised at the extent to which you can take CSS.</p>

<p>The most limiting factor is the fact that CSS doesn’t really have any on/off states…except for checkboxes and radio buttons. So I abused the hell out of them!</p>

<p>####The size of Surface
In total, including all the features, Surface weighs in at ~ 5.7kb minified and gzipped. That is absolutely tiny and I couldn’t be happier with this result.</p>

<p>This was such a major accomplishment for me, considering how large the neighbouring frameworks are. I posted this list in the <a href="http://benmildren.com/coding/2015/05/02/The-Making-Of-Surface.html">last blog post</a>, but I’ll throw it in here as well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Bootstrap - 174kb minified. No fonts. 1 dependency. 5 files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Foundation - 483kb minified. No fonts. 5 dependencies. 8 files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Materialize - 252kb minified. No fonts. 1 dependency. 3 files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surface - 5.7kb minified and gzipped. No fonts. 0 dependencies. 1 file.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Not only is the file size considerably smaller than the rest of the big gunner frameworks out there today, but the dependencies and amount of files are less too.</p>

<p>####Reception
I immediately posted Surface to a bunch of places on the web once I had launched it. Places like Reddit, Designernews and Twitter.</p>

<p>Where did it do best? Reddit. It’s always Reddit. I frickin’ love the Reddit community.</p>

<p>####Metrics</p>

<p>###What went wrong?</p>

<p>####The name
What a collosal mistake I made with the name.</p>

<p>Of course, I was well aware of the Microsoft product of the same name when considering names, I just didn’t feel that it would be that big of a deal to use the same name for my framework. Boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>My thought process was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The framework is based on Material Design, and a surface is a material (kind of)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A surface is a metaphor for foundations, something you can build on top of</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s a cool name</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The feedback received:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Searching for anything related to Surface will be eclipsed by Microsoft’s Surface.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the unintentional connotations of the relationship with Microsoft’s product, people were expecting Surface to be a spin on the Metro design style, not Material.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I was hoping this was a spin on the Metro design language given the name, but then it’s Material (which in some ways is a spin on the Metro design language, which is a spin on Swiss design). So…a Microsoft name and a Google design language. So confusing.</p>

<p>The above is a comment from one of the Reddit posts.</p>

<p>###The future
All in all, Surface was a great success. You’ll notice that the only thing I really felt went wrong was the choice of name.</p>

<p>Despite the name, Surface was an excellent learning experience for myself and hopefully I’ll have helped others with a tidy, lightweight framework going forward.</p>

<p>####Extra features
Whilst the CSS only rule was fun, to really move Surface forward I feel I must embrace Javascript. If I do ditch the CSS rule, I’ll be sure to use Javascript in a super light fashion also.</p>

<p>Features I’d like to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Carousel</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Page transitions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More animations</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Github repo for Surface has already had a few pull requests merged and issues fixed. I won’t be abandoning Surface anytime soon, and hope to really expand on it over the next year or so.</p>

<p>####The name
I would like to change the name. After the large backlash it received, it makes sense to change it’s name. But when?</p>

<p>As more and more time elapses, the harder it will be to change the name as it will take on a brand identity of its own.</p>

<p>So this is a big maybe…I’m not sure if it’ll happen.</p>

<hr />

<p>Overall, I hope you enjoy <a href="http://www.iamsurface.com">Surface</a> and find uses for it. I also would like to thank my loyal fans over at <a href="http://livecoding.tv">Livecoding</a> for watching me and helping me along the way.</p>
