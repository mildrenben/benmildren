  <article class="post-content">
    <p>If I don’t have a project to work on, I get bored very quickly. So when my girlfriend went back to University for a 2 week stint, I needed something to do or I would get antsy.</p>

<p>At my day job, I have been overhauling the styles that my company uses to make it more modern and based it on <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html">Google’s Material Design</a>. Sounds like good fun, right? Well, it’s not quite as fun as it seems.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, it is still fun and I do enjoy my job. But what I’m styling is unsemantic, old markup 99% of the time. So I’m making a bunch of styles based on Material Design for tables with inline styles. It means I have to be super specific when it comes to the CSS and use the dreaded !important quite a lot (the current count is up to 618). The sysytem is massive too, I’m still working on it and it’s taken me ~6 weeks so far.</p>

<p>So I have 2 weeks of free time, and I’ve been building a vast set of styles based on Material Design.</p>

<p>Why not build a framework for Material Design?</p>

<p>That’s what I’ve been doing. For the past 10 days, I’ve been building a Material Design framework for modern markup (so it is not going to work with my day job project).</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="competition">Competition</h2>

<p>Obviously, the big guns are the main competition. <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> are the most notable.</p>

<p>The big guns do everything. They are all encompassing.</p>

<p>If you need to use a date picker, then my framework will not be for you. I didn’t want to create a heavy framework with everything crammed in.</p>

<p>Besides the big guns, the only real Material Design framework in existance right now is <a href="http://materializecss.com/">Materialize</a>. Materialize is very good, but still what I would consider to be heavy. And in my own kind of arrogant manner I figured I could do some of the things better than they’ve done them.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="lightweight">Lightweight</h2>

<p>A huge part of what I wanted from this framework was for it to be super lightweight.</p>

<p>Here’s the numbers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Bootstrap - 174kb minified. No fonts. 1 dependency. 5 files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Foundation - 483kb minified. No fonts. 5 dependencies. 8 files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Materialize - 252kb minified. No fonts. 1 dependency. 3 files.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That is a lot of kb just for a framework, or at least in my opinion it is.</p>

<ul>
  <li>My Framework - 9kb minified. No fonts. 0 dependencies. 1 file.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="no-javascript">No Javascript</h2>

<p>This is the biggest limitation I placed on myself when building this framework. Absolutely, 100% zero Javascript.</p>

<p>Don’t worry, it still has all the features you’d expect of a framework, like modals, collapsibles and responsive navigation systems. I just used Sass to make them, not Javascript.</p>

<p>There were quite a few moments where I really wanted to use Javascript, like that pesky lightbox, but figured it’d actually be quite an acheivement to build a framework with a ton of components using only CSS. It would also mean we could serve just one file, making it even more lightweight.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="introducing-surface">Introducing Surface</h2>

<p>I decided on the name Surface, as it kind of relates to material and also is a metaphor for something ot be on top of. A foundation if you will.</p>

<p>If all things go to plan, Surface will be launching over this weekend.</p>

<h2 id="codepen-demos">Codepen Demos</h2>

<p>I tested a bunch of ideas on Codepen, check em out:</p>
